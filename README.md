I will find a better name. It is a bit weak, for now.

## Introduction

Yet another online markdown editor.

I created it, because of all the free available editors, none were quite right. I wanted a etherpap-like URL management, with live preview, and with the possibility to download a rendered pdf file. The collaboration part is really important, as this project started as an attempt to make writing reports less of a pain in the ass, so multiple user must be able to edit the same document.

So here we are. I wrote it in Python, with the [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) micro web framework, simply because I like the simplicity to deploy such applications. This uses also a javascript lib simplifying the multiple user editing [MUST. FIND. NAME.](#).

## Install
